    <h2>About the project</h2>

    <!-- DATA READING -->
    <p>This project represents an early stage for a simplified Smart Home Control Panel (SHCP).
        As such, there are some sensors and devices that an SCHP user can trigger or control manually.
        First off, there is a 'Temperature & Air Humidity' sensor, that gives relative readings, and can 
        potentially trigger a fan if the temperature is too high. 
        Secondly, there is an 'Air Quality' sensor that checks for the dust particles to evaluate the air purity.
        Once the readings are too high, for the purpose of testing, the sensor triggers a fan as well.
        Thirdly and lastly, there is a 'Motion' sensor, that is intended for detecting any motion in a closed space,
        and trigger LED lights on - the LEDs are turned off once no motion has been detected for over a minute. </p>
