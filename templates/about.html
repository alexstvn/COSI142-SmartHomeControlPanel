<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>This project represents an early stage for a simplified Smart Home Control Panel (SHCP).
    As such, there are some sensors and devices that an SCHP user can trigger or control manually.
    First off, there is a 'Temperature & Air Humidity' sensor, that gives relative readings, and can 
    potentially trigger a fan if the temperature is too high. 
    Secondly, there is an 'Air Quality' sensor that checks for the dust particles to evaluate the air purity.
    Once the readings are too high, for the purpose of testing, the sensor triggers a fan as well.
    Thirdly and lastly, there is a 'Motion' sensor, that is intended for detecting any motion in a closed space,
    and trigger LED lights on - the LEDs are turned off once no motion has been detected for over a minute. </p>

<!-- SENSORS USED -->
<h2>Sensors Used</h2>
<div class="abt-sensors" id="abt-sensors-div">

    <!-- AIR TEMP + HUMIDITY -->

        <div class="sensors-desc">
            <h4>Air Temperature and Humidity</h4>
            <p>This sensor monitors environmental temperature and humidity levels in real-time. It provides data that could trigger automated actions, such as turning on a fan or adjusting connected devices when temperatures or humidity reach specific thresholds.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- MOTION SENSOR -->
    <div class="abt-sensors-card abt-4-card">
        <img src="..\static\MotionDetector.png">
        <div class="sensors-desc">
            <h4>Motion Sensor</h4>
            <p>The motion sensor detects movement within a designated area. When motion is detected, it automatically turns on LED lights for visibility and convenience. After no motion is detected for a set period (e.g., one minute), the lights turn off to conserve energy.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- AIR QUALITY -->
    <div class="abt-sensors-card abt-4-card" >
        <img src="..\static\AirQualitySensor.png">
        <div class="sensors-desc">
            <h4>Air Quality Sensor</h4>
            <p>This sensor evaluates the air for particulate matter to determine air purity levels. If the air quality falls below acceptable thresholds, it can trigger a fan or other devices to improve air circulation, ensuring a healthier environment.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- LED St -->
    <div class="abt-sensors-card abt-4-card">
        <img src="..\static\LEDStrips.png">
        <div class="sensors-desc">
            <h4>LED Strip</h4>
            <p>The LED strips provide visual feedback and ambient lighting. They are connected to the motion sensor to turn on when motion is detected. Additionally, users can control their colors and on/off states manually or through automation rules on the server.</p>

<!-- OTHER TECH USED -->
<h2>Other Technologies Used</h2>
<div class="other-tech" id="other-tech-div">
    <!-- PLUG -->
    <div class="other-tech-card">
        <div class="other-tech-desc">
            <h4>Smart Plug (TP-LINK KASA)</h4>
            <p>The TP-LINK Kasa smart plug is integrated into the system to control connected devices remotely. Users can rename the plug based on its connected device, such as a fan or lamp. Automation rules allow the plug to react to sensor readings, enabling intelligent control of household appliances.</p>

    <!-- WIFI/HTTP -->
    <div class="other-tech-card">
        <div class="other-tech-desc">
            <h4>WIFI/HTTP</h4>
            <p>The system uses WiFi and HTTP protocols for seamless communication between sensors, devices, and the server. This technology ensures data from the sensors is streamed in real-time, enabling users to monitor readings, control devices, and set automation rules through the web interface.</p>
